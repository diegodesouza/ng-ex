# AutoProbe Properties #
########################

#######################
# On/Off Switch
#
# ================
# This boolean property gives you the ability to disable
# Introscope AutoProbe by settings the property value
# to false.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

introscope.autoprobe.enable=true


#######################
# Custom Log File Location
#
# ================
# Introscope AutoProbe will always attempt to log the changes
# it makes.  Set this property to move the location of the
# log file to something other than the default.  Non-absolute
# names are resolved relative to the location of this
# properties file.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

introscope.autoprobe.logfile=logs/AutoProbe.log


#######################
# Directives Files
#
# ================
# This property specifies all the directives files that determine
# how Introscope AutoProbe performs the instrumentation.  Specify
# a single entry, or a comma-delimited list of entries. The list 
# may include any combination of:
#    - directives (.pbd) files
#    - directives list (.pbl) files 
#    - directories that will be scanned about once per minute for  
#      .pbd files. Directives files placed in a listed directory
#      will be loaded automatically, without any need to edit this 
#      Agent profile. If dynamic instrumentation is enabled, the 
#      directives will take effect immediately without an app reboot.    
# Non-absolute names will be resolved relative to the location of 
# this properties file.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a required parameter and it MUST be set
# to a valid value.  
#    - If the property is not specified or the values are invalid, 
#      the Introscope Agent will not run!  
#    - If the property is set to include a directory, and invalid 
#      directives files are placed in the directory, AutoProbe  
#      metrics will no longer be reported!
#    - If the property is set to include a directory, and loaded 
#      directives files are removed from the directory, AutoProbe  
#      metrics will no longer be reported!
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property 
# take effect. However, if the property includes one or more directories, 
# and dynamic instrumentation is enabled, the Introscope Agent will load 
# directives files from the specified directories without an app restart, 
# as noted above.

# Transaction Tracer Configuration
#
# ================
# Configuration settings for Introscope Transaction Tracer

# The following settings configure Transaction Tracer to optionally
# capture the user ID used to invoke servlets and JSPs if it is stored
# in one of the three following ways.  Uncomment the set of properties
# that correspond to how user IDs are stored in your application.
# Make sure only one set of properties are uncommented or the wrong
# properties could be used.

# Uncomment the following property if the user ID is accessed through HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

#introscope.agent.transactiontracer.userid.method=HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser

# Uncomment the following properties if the user ID is accessed through HttpServletRequest.getHeader.
# Make sure to set the key that is used by your application.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

#introscope.agent.transactiontracer.userid.method=HttpServletRequest.getHeader
#introscope.agent.transactiontracer.userid.key=<application defined key string>

# Uncomment the following properties if the user ID is accessed through HttpSession.getValue.
# Make sure to set the key that is used by your application.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

#introscope.agent.transactiontracer.userid.method=HttpSession.getValue
#introscope.agent.transactiontracer.userid.key=<application defined key string>

# Uncomment the following properties to record specific http request headers, parameters or session
#  attributes in the Transaction Tracer data.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

# Uncomment the following property to specify the maximum number of components allowed in a Transaction 
# Trace.  By default, the clamp is set at 5000.   
# Note that any Transaction Trace exceeding the clamp will be discarded at the agent, 
# and a warning message will be logged in the Agent log file.
# Warning: If this clamp size is increased, the requirement on the memory will be higher and
# as such, the max heap size for the JVM may need to be adjusted accordingly, or else the 
# managed application may run out of memory.
# Changes to this property take effect immediately and do not require the managed application to be restarted.

# URL Grouping Configuration
#
# ================
# Configuration settings for Frontend naming.  By default, all frontends

# those that would generate a 404 error) do not create unique, one-time
# metrics -- this can bloat the EM's memory.  To get more meaningful

# are relevant to the deployment
